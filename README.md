## Introduction
This project demonstrates API testing using **Rest Assured** and **Cypress** for automating and validating API requests. The purpose is to ensure that the API endpoints are functioning as expected by performing various tests such as CRUD operations and authentication.

## Features
- Automated API testing for various endpoints.
- Supports both positive and negative test cases.
- Detailed assertions for response validation.
- Handles authentication and token-based testing.
- JSON response body validation.
  
## Tools & Technologies
- **Rest Assured** (Java)
- **Cypress** (JavaScript)
- **JUnit/TestNG** (for Rest Assured)
- **VS Code** (for Cypress)
- **Spring Tool Suite/Eclipse** (for Rest Assured)

## Test Scenarios
The following scenarios are covered:
- User creation, retrieval, update, and deletion.
- Login and logout functionality.
- Handling invalid requests and responses.
- Validating response codes, headers, and body content.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher (for Rest Assured)
- Node.js (for Cypress)
- Maven (for dependency management)
- VS Code and Spring Tool Suite or Eclipse

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/api-testing-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd api-testing-project
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   - For Rest Assured (Maven):
     ```bash
     mvn install
     ```
   - For Cypress:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

## Usage

### Running Rest Assured Tests
To run API tests using **Rest Assured**:
```bash
mvn test
```

### Running Cypress Tests
To run API tests using **Cypress**:
```bash
npx cypress open
```
This command will open the Cypress test runner, where you can select and run specific tests.

## Running Tests
- All tests are automated and can be run via the command line.
- Test reports are generated and stored in the `/target` folder (for Rest Assured).
- Cypress provides a built-in dashboard for viewing test execution results.
